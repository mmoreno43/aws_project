  <h1>About me</h1>
 
  <p>My name is Marcus Moreno and I live in Las Vegas. I never thought I would have a career in IT, but here I am with a CCNA and AWS Cloud Practictoner. Your probably wondering how I got here. Well,it all started with my Uncle Chad. He saw potential and told me to give it a shot.So, I left my amazing sister and friends behind along with my crazy dogs in Colorado. I started my IT journey with a company called Intellitech Consulting. I've done mostly layer 1 gigs for them, but hoping to move up the ladder soon.</p>

  <h2>About this site</h2>
  
  <p>I've started with creating an HTML file where I wrote the code for this site. I then upload it to Github where Travis CI checks for any errors. If there are errors, it will return an error and will let me know about it. If there are no errors, then Travis CI will push the new file to my S3 bucket.</p>
