  <h1>About me</h1>
 
  <p>My name is Marcus Moreno and I work live in Las Vegas. I never thought I would have a career in IT, but here I am with a CCNA and AWS Cloud Practictoner. Your probably wondering how I got here. Well,it all started with my Uncle Chad. He saw potential and told me to give it a shot. So, I left my amazing sister and friends behind along with my crazy dogs in Colorado. I started my IT journey with a company called Intellitech Consulting. I've done mostly layer 1 gigs for them, but hoping to move up the ladder soon.</p>

  <h2>About this site</h2>
  
  <p>I've started with creating an HTML file where I wrote the code for this site. I then upload it to github where Travis CI checks for any errors. If there are errors, it will return an error and will not update the master branch. I then have to manually upload to an S3 bucket in AWS. I am hoping this will change as I learn more. After that, I also upload it to me gitlab.</p>
