      <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Marcus Moreno and I live in Las Vegas. I never thought I would have a career in IT, but here I am with my CCNA and AWS Cloud Practitioner. Your probably wondering how I got here. Well, it all started with my Uncle Chad. He saw potential and told me to give it a shot. So, I left my amazing sister and friends behind along with my crazy dogs in Colorado. I started my IT journey with a company called Intellitech Consulting. I've done mostly layer 1 gigs for them, but hoping to move up the ladder soon.</p>
